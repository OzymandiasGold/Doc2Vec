# Doc2Vec
Doc2Vec Model using gensim with a restaurant review dataset.

Following on, there are also examples of Cosine similarity in between sentences and a restaurant review (pulled off Google).

There are also comparisons of the vectors of sentences with each other, these are on the last line and are commented out.
These sentences are a random connection of adjectives which are then compared with one another to see the cosine similarity.

For example: cosine similarity between the sentences "Good bad terrible" and "Good bad okay" is more similar then the first sentence and the sentence "Good awful disgusting".

Play around with it.
